            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Maior is a-lowed of all proteſtants, becauſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the fiute of faith: The minor they alſo graunt, for he that once had faithe, can neuer looſe it, Dauid had faith before, therfore by ſinninge, he loſt it not. This poynt I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more largely, becauſe I take it that thouſandes of oure countrie men are gone to the deuill grounded vpon this hereticall foundation. And I harde of men of good credit, that there was a puritan of late that killed him ſelfe not farr from London &amp; left writen vpon a table, that no man ſhould conceiue ill of his death, becauſe he knew him ſelfe one of gods elected, &amp; therfore he ſhortned his dayes to go to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.

            <p>Many moe erroures I fynde in the proteſtants religion which ouerthrowe good workes, but eſpecially one that toucheth to the quick &amp; ſtingethe to the verie harte of deuotion &amp; piety, that is want of free will to do wel. For if we wante free will, then all good workes procede from vs by a certaine neceſſity &amp; compulſion, neither lyeth it in our power, to ſerue God when we will, faſt when we will, loue God when we will: neither can we pray more feruently, nor faſt more rigou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſlye, nor loue God more exactly, if we reſolue oure ſelues neuer ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, becauſe it lyeth not in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to performe thoſe determinations although we be guyded &amp; aſſiſted by godds grace. This hereſy, for that I know it haith made great impreſſion in many mennes harts, and the verie thought therof might not impeache a little all my labour &amp; induſtry, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe good ſoules to receiue: by gods grace brefly I intend to ouerthrow.
<pb facs="tcp:13329:10"/> For of all other it ſemeth to me, not onely impious, abſurde, and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but alſo ſenceles &amp; moſt palpably to be perceiued.</p>
            <p>Three or foure arguments onely I meane to propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, reſeruing the reſt for amore conueuient place.</p>
            <p>Firſte I will begin with comon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that euery man prouethe in him ſelfe, for as ſenſibly as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in my ſelf free wil to ſitt downe &amp; ryſe vpp, to open myne eyes and ſhutt them: ſo euidently &amp; ſenſibly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nowe I perceiue, that if I will, I may pray &amp; not pray, geue almes &amp; not geue almes, faſte to day and not faſte, ſay in my harte, o lorde I loue thee, &amp; preſently make a raſh oath or offend god. And in truth he that will deny theſe experiences, may aſwell deny that he ſeeth or heareth, his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res being attent, &amp; his eyes vnſhutt.</p>
            <p>But the proteſtantes ſay, this can not be done without Godds grace, &amp; did euer Catholick deny this? Had not Adam before his fall accordinge to the proteſtants doctrine, free will?
<pb facs="tcp:13329:11"/> and yet he neither could pray nor loue God without grace. But this doctrine repugneth with goddes woorde. This we deny, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The laſte reaſon ſhall be reaſon it ſelfe, for in truth as experience doth manifeſtly proue our liberty: ſo reaſon doth without reply conuince it. The firſte reaſon, is remorſe of conſcience in this lyfe &amp; in hell. For if men had not libertie, remorſe ſhoulde be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſhed. For what euill ſoeuer we do of neceſſitie, preſently we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it, &amp; acquite our conſcience with the impoſſibilitie. As if a man ſhould drinke poyſen, not knowinge, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would haue any ſcruple of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe it was inauoydable, he could not preuent it. But if he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it of him ſelfe, or mighte haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented it &amp; woulde not: then the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of conſcience, will preſently rack hi, becauſe he might haue done good ſaued his owne lyfe, &amp; would not. For he that reſiſteth any ſinn doth wel accordinge to that ſayinge, <hi>Beatus ille</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 31</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:13329:21"/> 
               <hi>qui potuit tranſgredi, &amp; non eſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus.</hi> Againe the torture, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Conſcience, that ſtickethe ſo depe with her ſtinge in the ſoule of all damned creatures, ſhoulde neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in hell, if man weare depryued of libertie. For their torment conſiſteth in this, that for their owne demerites being created of God in ſuche ſorte, that if they would, heauen laide open for them by doing well: and yet they caſt them ſelues into hell by their own accorde by woorking euill. For if they could not haue done well but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie weare plunged into finne, I ſee not what remorſe they can haue.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is, for that noe Law with iuſtice can be enacted, but ſuch as may be obſerued, becauſe the ende of the law is to make good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, &amp; therfore it weare moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde, that all men were not able to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kepe that law, which was ordeyned for all men. Againe euery law may be preuaricated, for els why ſhould pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be annexed to the law? and ſo conſequently euery law ſuppoſe the
<pb facs="tcp:13329:22"/> libertie. Moreouer the verie ſtate of man, who is as it weare in this world fighting, requyreth libertie. For ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding betwene heauen &amp; hell, God &amp; the deuill, placed in this theater either to ouercome or be ouercome: all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon requyred, that he might be plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both wayes, &amp; of a flexible will, either to accept god, or reiecte him, folowe Sathan, or purſue him, yelde to his temptations, or reſiſt them, as by practiſe we ſee effected in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall comedie of Iob. For if Iob had lacked free will to do well, what great maſterie had it bene for God, with ſuch neceſſary grace, to haue ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sathan? But Iob hauinge free will, frayle fleſhe, aſſaulted of the deuill, purſued of his frendes, tempted by his wyfe, ſpoyled of his riches, bereaued of his children, vlcered in body, and yet to ouercome all inſernall forces, by ſuche grace of God, as he mighte haue vſed or abuſed at his pleaſure: plainely conuinceth the greate victory both of God &amp; Iob againſt the deuill, becauſe for godds loue, his changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:13329:22"/> will, perſeuered without change.</p>
            <p>Scotus one of the mirroures of witt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that euer this worlde brought forthe, thought the experience of free will ſo palpable, that he iudged the truthe therof not able to be proued by any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, then by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the denyer ſo longe, till he con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſed that the whipper had free will to whipp him, &amp; to leaue whipping. So in good ſooth I thinke if any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter weare in lyke caſe, he woulde confeſſe, that the whipper mighte for the loue of God, let him alone if he would, and procede in his beatinge if he liſted.</p>
            <p>If we wante free will, what Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall that be in Scriptures ſo oft <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> tymes repeated, that euery man ſhall receiue accordinge to his woorkes? What Iuſtice will there appeare to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men eternally for ſinne &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, to whom it was impoſſible to do any good? Or what rewarde ſhall that be which God beſtowethe vpon them, that weare compelled to doe well, neither was it in their power to
<pb facs="tcp:13329:23"/> doe euill.</p>
            <p>In myne opinion, all the theues &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> harlottes whom the proteſtantes haue puniſhed in this tyme of erroure, ſhall geue teſtimonie againſt this hereticall aſſertion. For certainly when the thefe ſtoale, &amp; the harlot abuſed her bodie, they did it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vehement temptation, (for otherwyſe they neuer would haue plunged both theire ſoules &amp; bodies into ſo great daungers.) This temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then I demaunde if they could haue reſiſted at that tyme or noe? If not, what law will hang a man ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thinge vnauoydable, for it layde not in the theeues power to auoyde it? If he could reſiſt it, then he had liberty to do a good woorke &amp; did it not, &amp; conſequently anſweared not the grace of God (without which he could not reſiſt any vehement temptation) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he might haue frely anſweared.</p>
            <p>Finally this errou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is the roote of all licentiouſnes. For thus God knoweth two may reaſon in Englande, and in the proteſtantes ſchole inſolubly; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue grace to do well or not,
<pb facs="tcp:13329:23"/> If I haue it, then it is impoſſible to do euill, if I haue it not, it is impoſſible to do well, for all goodnes procedeth of grace which compelleth our willes, &amp; all euill cometh of lack of grace, which we haue not at our wills. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all Epicures liue as licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they will, all riotous perſons paſſe theire dayes in all diſſolution, for this erroure will warrante them ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
            <p>The arguments or rather ſophiſmes that proteſtantes bring againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, experimented, practiſed, &amp; allowed veritie, in all antiquitie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue rather hiſſing then anſwearinge, yet one I will anſweare, that by it the reader may Iudge of the reſte.</p>
            <p>They alledge forſothe that parte of the ſcripture in the parable, where the <note place="margin">Luc. 14</note> Kinge commaunded his ſeruantes, to compell them that they founde in the high wayes, to come to his marriage dinner, &amp; the other ſcripture wheare <note place="margin">Cau. 1.

<pb facs="tcp:13329:24"/> a ſolution, for by this drawing &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulſion, the ſcripture meanethe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that god vſeth great helps to drawe men vnto him, for which they are in excuſable if they come not. As if one inuyte me to ſupper, yet I excuſe my ſelf, he inſiſteth with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons, at the laſt he induceth me: after I ſay, he compelled me to come he brought ſo many perſwaſions. For do we not ſee that one of them which weare compelled, came withoute a mariage garment? ſo that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion <note place="margin">Mat. 22</note> of godds grace, ſlandeth with the abuſe thereof.</p>
            <p>I haue bene longer in this preface, then perhappes the proportion of the gate with the howſe requyred by iuſte Ceintrie, yet the opportunitie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, cauſeth builders often times to breake their ſquare, as it befalleth me at this preſente.

               <p>AS there be two ſortes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom Chriſte haith inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his table, ſinners &amp; iuſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo he haith appointed two ſorts of preparations, the firſt of neceſſitie, the other of decency: the lack of the one cauſeth damnation, the wante of the other, impeacheth deuotion: Of that is ſaid, <hi>Probet ſemetipſum homo, &amp; ſic</hi>

               <p>He that is waſhed, nedeth not but to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13329:37"/> waſhe his feete. Of theſe two prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I meane to deliuer all that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in this treatiſe. And firſt of all what preparation of neceſſitie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are commaunded to bringe when they come to participate theſe ſacred miſteries. Vndoubted it is, that who ſoeuer will eate this foode &amp; not to his damnation, muſt come without ſpott of mortall ſinne, that is in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he perſwadeth him ſelfe, that he is in the fauoure &amp; grace of God.</p>
               <p>Many reaſons I coulde bringe, to confirme this poſition, but for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I will content my ſelfe with two.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the generall rule of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing ſacramentes, that whoſoeuer participateth them in mortall ſinn (ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept baptiſme and penaunce) ſinnethe mortally, yea &amp; ſacrilegiouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hinderethe the influence of God in his vaines of grace, fruſtratinge the Sacramentes of theire effectes, which queſtionleſſe can not be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greate iniurie to allmightie God, and a notorious irreuerence vnto his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes of grace.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:13329:37"/>
               <p>The Second reaſon, is peculiar &amp; proper to the Euchariſt where Chriſt is receyued: for who dare receiue him being his mortall enemy? what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is betwixt God &amp; Beliall? life <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6</note> &amp; death? light &amp; darknes? a denn of deuils, &amp; the glorie of Angells? a ſink of filth, &amp; the God of puritie?</p>
               <p>This is that Iudgment S. Paule ſaid they eate, not iudginge the bodie of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11</note> our Lord, but caſting ſo precious a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, into ſo lothſome a dongehill: ſo ſweete a liquor, in ſo ſtinkinge a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, the dainties of heauen, in a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of hell. This can not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a horrible offence &amp; a moſt hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous cryme. Theſe ſaith S. Ciprian, <note place="margin">Libr. de caena do.</note> lick the ſtone, but neither ſuck honie nor oyle: &amp; better had it bene for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a milſtone about their neckes, to <note place="margin">Deu. 32 Mat. 18</note> haue bene drowned in the bothom of the ſea. A man therfore that haithe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted a mortall ſinne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to eate at this table, except he obteine firſt forgeuenes thereof, at the handes of God, the which he may get by contrition, that is a moſt profound
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13329:38"/> &amp; internall griefe rooted in the loue of God, &amp; hatred of ſinnes, as iniuries done to him.</p>
               <p>But this preparation, becauſe it is verie harde to come by, &amp; ſeldom ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners addicted to the worlde, returne to him with ſuch perfection of loue: therfore the holie counſell of Trente <note place="margin">Seſ. 13 Cap. 7</note> remembred a laudable practiſe, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly exercyſed before in the church, that no man guiltie of mortall ſinne, ſhould receiue this Sacramente, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out premittinge ſacramentall confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the difficultie of contrition, &amp; the enormous ſacraledge of eatinge our Sauiour without remiſſion of ſinnes did moue the Church to premitt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as a way more eaſie and more ſecure.</p>
               <p>After the ſoule be waſhed, with this laborious baptiſme of penaunce, it muſte in effect, or at the leaſte in firme purpoſe, performe, all that an entyre &amp; compleate confeſſion requvrethe.</p>
               <p>The vſerer muſt make reſtitution, &amp; deſiſt from all his trade: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chante muſte reſtoare his euill gotten
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13329:38"/> goodes, rectify his contracts, vſe iuſt meaſures, &amp;c. He that liued in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, muſt procure reconciliation. He that paſſed his dayes riotouſly, muſt leaue his euell company, auoyde dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous &amp; experimented occaſions of deadly ſinne: finally he muſte agree with his aduerſary whyle he walkethe in the way, that is, his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it accuſe him not one day, before his Iudge, when theare is noe place of appellation, nor tyme of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendemente.</p>
               <p>A caſe of conſcience mighte heare be proponed, for Catholickes in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande: if beinge in priſon for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; not hauing any meanes to com to a prieſt to confeſſion: if ſuch a one mighte receiue the bleſſed Sacrament withoute Confeſſion, hauinge onely contrition of his ſinnes. Some will ſay, let him confeſſe by writing: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſſion by writing, be auale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or noe, I will not now diſpute, I know theare are ſome that defende it, but I can not allowe it, becauſe by letters, I can not knowe the preſente
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13329:39"/> ſtate of the penitent, when I geue the abſolution: it may be he remembreth ſo me other mortall ſinne, the which he would confeſſe before I abſolue him: it may be he ſinneth at the ſame time: it may be he haith ſome circumſtance neceſſary to be confeſſed. Yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be a true opinion or noe, I houlde it in noe wyſe conuenient, to be practiſed in Englande, for the ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall that might occurr, if any ſuch let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were intercepted by proteſtants. Therefore I am oſ opinion, that ſuch a perſon after that he haith endeuored for his poſſibilitie, with praiers to god with greife of ſinnes, with a firme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe neuer to fall againe; that he may receiue the bleſſed ſacramente with contrition, although he can not come to confeſſion: becauſe the precept of confeſſion, beinge appoynted by the Churche, we are to ſuppoſe, that ſhe neuer intended thereby, to hinder ſuch good ſoules from the blood of Chriſt, who ſtand prepared to offer their blood for Chriſt. And it ſeemeth not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the bowells of pietye, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13329:39"/> her children, in ſuch extreame conflictes, of all ſpirituall armour, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt the aduerſaries of her faith.</p>
               <p>After then I am confeſſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende infallibly, with Goddes grace, to performe all that concerneth a good confeſſion, I may preſently after I haue breathed forth ſo many ſinnes, receiue the bleſſed ſacrament.</p>
               <p>After this diſpoſition, I am not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder a mortall ſinne, to any other preparation, for by confeſſion, I am reconcyled to God, indued with his grace, appareled with the weddinge <note place="margin">Mat. 22</note> garment appoynted for this feaſt, an nombred amongeſte the frendes and children of God, writen as an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for the citie of Angels. Yet the remembrance of my paſſed offences, the ſhame of my tranſgreſſions, the horrour of diſpleaſinge ſo ſoueraigne a maieſtie, ought a little to withdraw me from kiſſinge his ſyde, which not longe before, I had ſo notoriouſly wounded: to make retyre from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracinge him, whoſe loue not long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, ſo baſely I diſpyſed: to cauſe me
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13329:40"/> ſtay my foote for vſing him ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, whoſe frendſhip hard before, I diſdayned ſo contemptuouſly.</p>
               <p>Therfore I will diſpoſe my ſelfbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the dignitie of his perſon, the perfection of his loue, the admirable frutes and graces, which this bleſſed foode affordeth, to all thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignely receiue it, the which prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be preſently declared.</p>

               <head>CAP. 4.</head>
               <p>I Once demaunded of a godly and deuoute Religious man, what was the moſte forcible meane, that he by longe experience had proued, to helpe a man to pray well &amp; deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? He anſweared me, a good lyfe, continually to liue well: The which meane in verie deede is moſt forcible, for ſuch men haue theire hartes reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Goddes graces, their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions burſte not forthe vehemently, theire ſoules are indued with many good habits, they fall rarely, ryſe more feruently, and conſequently conuerſe with God more familiarly, and pray more deuoutly. I ſay after that maner what preparation principally oughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we to bringe to the Euchariſte? a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall good lyfe. What ſecondly?
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13329:41"/> A continuall vertuous lyfe. What Thirdly? I anſweare the ſame. For thoſe that liue religiouſly, quickly can reuyue &amp; ſtirr vpp, the grace of God that lodgeth in their hartes; they can preſently with one blaſte, accende the flame of Charitie.</p>
               <p>But becauſe we fynde few of this ſtampe, therfore we muſt deſcende to more particularities, That all thoſe who for the tyme paſte, haue lyued lowſely, or at this preſent fall often, yet by Goddes grace recouer againe, or contend not much to goe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but will be content with a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine mediocritie; yet would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe forwarde, els they muſt nedes goe backwardes, becauſe in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, there is noe ſtaying in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one poynte of holines, but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, they muſt either aſcende, or deſcende, as a boate goinge againſte the ſtreame, muſt either goe forwarde or backwarde.</p>
               <p>For theſe therfore, <hi>incipientes, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientes,</hi> for them that begin to ſerue God, &amp; them that haue made ſome
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13329:41"/> progreſſe in goddes ſeruice, theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes may ſerue. For faſting, wearinge of ſhirtes of hayre, diſciplines, almes deedes, lying harde, and other lyke mortifications &amp; holy exercyſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bodie: theare can no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripte generall rule be geuen: for as the complexions, abilities, &amp; meanes to effect theſe are different; euen ſo the practiſe of all can not be alyke, but theſe rules may be taken as conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente.</p>
               <p>Firſte the more a man mortifiethe his body by prudence and diſcretion, the leſſe difficultie he ſhall fynd in all his ſpirituall exercyſes, becauſe one of the greateſt enemies we haue, is our bodie, if it be pampered, &amp; therfore mortification, is a good preparation.</p>
               <p>Secondly the beſt diſcretion in this, I take to be an obediente mynde of the peuitente, to his ghoſtly father, that he propound his deſires, and the other approue or diſproue them: for comonly a man is not the ſureſt iudg in his owne cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly all thoſe who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13329:42"/> once a monthe, or once euerie weeke, ought to vſe ſom one or two of theſe mortifications: for this ſacred mirhe, will preſeme oure ſenſes from corruption: theſe ſpirituall actions, in tyme, will ſpiritualize oure carnall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp; make them fitte inſtrumentes to ſerue oure ſoules, as harboures for the ſacred euchariſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly theſe ſerue as preambles, for this bleſſed Sacrifice: for as Chriſt did ſuffer many cruell paines, before he ſacrifiſed vppe him ſelfe vpon the Croſſe: euen ſo we (that muſte dye with Chriſt ſpiritually by compaſſion in this ſacrament, &amp; ſuffer with him, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2</note> to glorie with him) ought to prepare oure ſelues to this holy Sacrifice, with ſome painefull mortification.</p>
               <p>Theſe premiſed, it foloweth that we entreate of thoſe ſpirituall meditations, deuout exercyſes, &amp; godly preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that all good ſoules may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niontly, eaſely, breefely, &amp; religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe, before they ſitt downe to this table, all which I reduce to ſixe actes of fyue vertues. And the verie
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13329:42"/> ſame which the Councell of Trente reckeneth, as diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: thoſe I Iudge moſt fitt preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the ſacred communion: Feare, Faith, Hope Charitie, Repentance, which I deuyde into two operations, deteſtation of oure paſſed lyfe, and a firme reſolution, not to fall againe, the which for memory ſake, I thought good to comprehend in this one word Feare: For Feare of it ſelfe, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto me, the firſte acte. F, the firſt letter of Faith: Faith, Hope, and Charity. R, the ſecond Conſonante, Repentance, the which can neuer be effectuall, except it carne with it greif for ſinnes paſte, and a reſolute good will of amendment. Theſe be thoſe ſixe winges which the Seraphims, that are inflammed with loue, weare furniſhed withall, when <note place="margin">Iſa. 6</note> they appeared before the throne of the maieſtie of God. And all deuout ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks indued with them, may haue free acceſſe vnto the tree of lyfe, the ſcate of God, that is his altar.</p>
               <p>Theſe be ſixe gates, through which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13329:43"/> all courteours muſte paſſe, that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter into the preſence chamber, to deale with the king of heauen.</p>
               <p>Theſe be ſixe harbingers who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the lodging of the holy Ghoſte in iuſtification, &amp; moſt fitt to doe the ſame office for the ſonne of God, in the communion. For if theare we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into frendſhip with the holie Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, here we renew it &amp; increaſe it: If the are we aboliſhed deadly ſinns, here we extinguiſhe veniall: If theare we lefte the deuill, the fleſh, &amp; the world heare we triumph ouer them: If there we weare vnited to god in ſpirit, here we are ioyned both in bodie &amp; ſoule: If theare we gathered the bloſſomes of grace, &amp; firſt frutes of glory, heare we reape the cropp of them both.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the holy Ghoſte in iuſtification, appoynted the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid vertues, as ornamentes to decke the ſoule againſt his entrance: in lyke ſorte our bleſſed Sauioure equall vnto him, &amp; of the ſame ſubſtance, ſemeth to exacte of vs, the lyke preparations for his interteinemente.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:13329:43"/>
               <p>Of theſe ſixe therefore, ſome fewe diſcourſes I meane to delyuer: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I thought good to aduertyſe thee gentle reader, that if tyme &amp; opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie will permitte: it weare good to take ſome two or three of thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or effectes of this Sacrament, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in the former booke, of the cauſes why God inſtituted this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Banquet: &amp; euery day to ſtinte a tyme, to meditate or conſider, the admirable good, which iſſuethe from this fountaine of lyfe.

But the day will come, when they will curſe this helliſh feare, which hindreth them of the ioyes of heauen, and heaped vpon them, the paines of hell.

                  <head>VNION IN AFFECTION.</head>
                  <p>THis Vnion of affection, the beſt ofſpring of Charitie, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth the ſomme of all perfection: wherof he that intendeth to fill his ſoule with Goddes fauoures &amp; graces, muſte perfume it with this ſacred incenſe, and conforme his will with goddes will, his intention, with Goddes intention, his deſyres, with Goddes deſyres. For in verie deede, this maketh not onely a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but alſo a perfect ſpirituall man.</p>
                  <p>Two thinges ſpecially God deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, for which he created this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie maſſe of the world, his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp; oure ſanctity or rather lett vs ſay but one, take whether of them you will: oure holines, is his glorie, &amp; his glorie, is our holines. For gods glorie is, that we thinke of him, as creatures of theire Creator: That we knowledge him, ſerue him, and loue him in our ſelues, procuring continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that others do the ſame, and this is our holines.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:13329:56"/>
                  <p>He therefore that pretendethe, to make an exquiſyte preparation, Let him heare dilate his hart, and extende his affection. I know ſome good ſoules in the world, who euery morning ſo ſoone as they awake, the firſt woorde that iſſueth owt of their mouth is this, O Lord graunt me that I may ſpende this day moſt feruently to thyne honor &amp; glory. And as often as they heare the clock ſtryke, paſſe by any church ſee any Image, they renew this ſwete &amp; angelicall breath. And truly in this poynt, we ſhoulde be lyke the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous marchantes, who let noe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſſe wheare they think they may gaine. You may ſee how they ſtand expecting at their ſtawles, euery looke or glaunce, euery ſtop or ſtay, of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers, is a ſufficiente motiue, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyte or call them to buy: So ſhoulde theſe ſoules doe, who are trayned vpp in the ſhopp of deuotion, and loue of God, lett paſſe noe little occaſion, wheare they may glorify God by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their owne ſoules, by benefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their neighboures. For I lett paſſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13329:56"/> the bound we haue to doe ſo, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers benefites god haith beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. I omitt the exceſſe of meritts we offer vpp to God: I will ſay nothing of the feruent loue of God which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth it, but that this affection, this deſyre, this thirſte of goddes glory, is a greate ſigne of predeſtination. For I am not ignorant, that Fathers aſſign many great &amp; notable coniectures, of the preſent grace &amp; fauoure of god, of eternall predeſtination &amp; future bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes: as to lyue alonge tyme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mortall ſinne, is a good ſigne of preſent grace, &amp; predeſtination, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cret ſinnes creepe in often, &amp; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remiſneſſe of good woorks, crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the brake many times, wherein men ſemed to ſayle ſecurely.</p>
                  <p>Patience in aduerſitie, arguethe a ſtedfaſtnes of mynde, and exceeſſe of fortitude, but yet often he that is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to day, loſeth his patience to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he that was patiente in looſinge his goodes, will not ſticke to fall into ſome other ſinne, or if he be patient in one matter, he is impatiente in an
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13329:57"/> other. To heare willingly the woord of God, (ſo our Sauiour taught vs) is a good ſigne, for he that affectethe goddes woord comonly haithe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to obſerue it, but this ſigne often fayleth, for many for vaine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie, or to manteyne theire wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpirites, as Calueniſtes are neuer quyet, but when their eares are tikled with itchinge ſermons, or cauelinge cathechiſmes. To loue and pray for our enemies, is a good ſigne of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, a note of greate charitie, but yet it may proceede of a certaine naturall diſpoſition of a noble mynde, rather then the true loue of god. For many diſdayn to reuenge iniuries done vnto them, for a naturall inclination to magnanimity, as the eagle to ſeaze vpon the flies, although they moleſt her. Martyrdome, a confeſſion of Chriſtes faithe, a ſealinge of his loue with blood, is an excellent ſigne, but yet we ſee how many heritykes haue offered them ſelues to death for their phantaſticall opinions. Yet in my Iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, this affection, this neuer-reſting
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13329:57"/> deſyre of Goddes glorie, this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall procuring of a mannes own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or the ſpirituall good of his neighboure, is as manifeſte a ſigne of predeſtination, as any of the reſt. For ſuch ſoules are lyke vnto a needle tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the loade ſtone, that neuer reſtethe till it be fixed with the pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarr: euen ſo they touched with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, ueuer reſt night nor day, eatinge &amp; drinkinge, at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, in priſon &amp; in libertie, they are alwayes ſtirringe, they neuer can be quyet, till they be vnited with their pole, with god in heauen.</p>
                  <p>I know this ſigne doth not inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proue that a man is in grace, or predeſtinate, yet it is one of the beſte coniectures, becauſe it carriethe with it ſo many exceſſes of vertue internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and externally for a mannes owne perfection, &amp; the perfection of others towardes God &amp; our neighboures.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it can not proceede but from moſt vehement Charitie, and a continuall motion of goddes grace.</p>

                  <p>He then that cometh to the Euchariſt, ought to renew this good purpoſe, of obſeruinge the commaundementes of God, becauſe this Sacrament beinge inſtituted, to fortifye and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate oure ſoules, enablinge them to obſerue more exactly, the preceptes of God: What a notable diſpoſition will it be, to propounde with oure ſelues, moſt firmly to kepe them?

                  <p>Yet in theſe, I fynde degrees, for ſome bringe more &amp; ſome leſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of gods grace, &amp; their free willes, for ſo God haith tempered them together, &amp; tuned na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the key of grace, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of perſection in either parte ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the harmony much more ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; ſpecially becauſe the increaſe of vertue ſo dependeth vpon vs, that goddes grace is euer addreſſed to help vs to a greater degree then we accept of, or put in execution, as I ſaid, the riuer euer yeldeth more water, then we bring from it.</p>
                  <p>Yet heare it is to be noted, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly diuynes graunt, that in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by three cauſes, our grace, Charitie, &amp; perfection, are augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

So that if one weare in grace, &amp; had noe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition at all, he ſhoulde receyue a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13329:65"/> certayne degree of grace, as when li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children in paſſed ages did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, although they brought noe preparation actually, yet becauſe they weare in grace, thaire grace was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; the reaſon whereof we gather owt of thoſe woordes of Chriſt, <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manducat me, &amp; ipſe viuit propter me.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Io. 6</note> He that eateth me, liueth for me.

                  <p>The ſeconde increment of Grace, procedeth from the diſpoſition, for if a man feare, beleeue, hope, &amp;c. or exercyſe any acte of vertue: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth it with preſent grace, &amp; ſome degree of future glory.</p>

Becauſe he weare verie blockiſhe that woulde ſay, that vertue is better rewarded of god when a ſinner beginneth to lyue vertuouſly, then when a iuſt man continuethe his loyalty &amp; ſeruyce to god, for ſo grace ſhould be a hinderance to reward, and ſinne a furtherance: and a man merit leſſe being goddes frende, then when he was his enemye: the which is not onelye abſurde, but alſo foliſhe. He therefore that diſpoſethe his ſoule by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13329:66"/> the aforeſaid vertuous operations, for them precyſely receyuethe a certaine degree of grace &amp; glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he receyuethe increaſe by the vnion of theſe two: that is, God communicateth one portion of grace for the Sacramente precyſelye, one portion for the diſpoſition precyſely, &amp; one portion, for the coniunction of theſe two: that is, this Sacramente conferrethe a certayne limited portion of grace by it ſelfe, yet when it fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſubiect better diſpoſed, and more capable: accordinge to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, our Sauiour increaſeth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, not vnlyke to the Soonne, which communicateth more lighte to thoſe ſubiectes, who are clearer and more tranſpara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as we proue in glaſſe, Chriſtall, water, &amp; aere. The reaſon of this exceſſe, procedethe from the maner that God vſeth in conforming grace as neare as may be, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of nature, in her operations.</p>
                  <p>This augmentation and growth in grace, requytethe aboundantly, the litle laboure and paynes we beſtow in

                  <p>For what is it to grow in grace? To haue our Soules refyned more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; the Image of God more lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed in them?

That is, you ſhall looſe your ſpirituall lyfe the heate of Charity, for without this garment it vaporeth forth. Therefore we muſt procure the Euchariſt, to kepe in the vapoures &amp; exhalations, that the ſoule may be warme with piety &amp; deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Beſydes, the Euchariſt is meate, it noriſheth, &amp; what more preſerueth &amp; manteyneth oure naturall heate, then meate? Therefore the Euchariſte in this ſurpaſſeth all ſortes of garmentes: for it doth not onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue the heate of oure ſoules that we haue, but alſo addeth an internall heate, which noe garment affordeth.</p>
               <p>The Euchariſte ſecondarily, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteth vs from iniuries of ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, who with tempeſtes of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, with congealed froſtes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked examples, with boyſterous windes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13329:71"/> of perſecutions, contende to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſpirituall heate of grace and Charitie: But that table which Chriſt haith prepared for Dauid, againſte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that afflicted him: ſupplyeth the want <note place="margin">Pſal. 22</note> of a winters robe, no could can pearce it, no winde paſſe through it.</p>
               <p>The Euchariſt thirdly, adorneth the receauers, by making one body with them: by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating to the ſoule, the richeſt treaſures of heauen: by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duinge it with vertues: by refyninge the Image of God: by deifying all de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uout Communicants with his preſence. No ſcarlet, no purple, no ſtones, no pearles, no dyamondes, no clothe of tiſſue: may be compared to this attire. For as the ſoule ſurpaſſethe by thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes the body in perfection: ſo the garmentes of the ſoule, the garments of the bodie, by millions, in degree of excellency.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the Euchariſt was repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe garmentes which Iacob <note place="margin">Gen. 27</note> appeared withall before his oulde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſaack, who feeling the fragrante ſmell thereof, <hi>tanquam agri pleni, cui</hi>

Heare the ſoule appearinge before God with the ſpirituall garmentes of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt: the eternall Father, our true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by creation, our Father which is in heauen, perceauing the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſente of this perfumed attyre: by the handes of the holy Ghoſt, raineth vpon vs his celeſtiall benediction, the dew of grace, and internall vertues, the fatt of the earthe, the frutes of all good woorkes, aboundance of corne &amp; wyne, that is, the meanes how to receaue his bleſſed body &amp; blood, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the formes of breade &amp; wyne, as often as we deſyre, for this queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, is an exceding &amp; excellente be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.</p>
               <p>Therefore I beſech thee o ſwete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, ſince this Sacrament will couer ſo well myne ignominye and ſhame, conſerue the naturall heate of my ſoule defende me from externall iniuries,

Let me not be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the ſkinnes of beaſtes, that is the garmentes of ſenſualitie, but with the robes of Angelles, the purple of Charitie.</p>
               <p>But what is this contradiction ſwete Ieſu I here in thy ſpeach? Thou ſaieſt that I am miſerable, poore, blynde, &amp; naked. Howe can a begger buy ſo riche a treaſure? How can he that haith not cloathes to ſerue his neceſſity, bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaine for ſuche marchandize, as will cauſe ſuperfluitie?

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13329:72"/> buy it, &amp; not buy it, which is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradiction.</p>
               <p>O bleſſed Sauioure, glory for euer be to thy name. Ah, no man appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe ſo beggerly before him, but he may, (if he will) buy the moſte pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious treaſure of heauen, the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Euchariſt, this obryzed gould, this new goulde, this glowing gould, <note place="margin">Apoc. 3</note> this approued gould, this goulde that will enryche him for euer. For God aſſiſtethe all men with his Grace, to ſaue them if they will vſe it: He knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> to enter, if they will open the doore of theire hartes: He ſoweth the ſeede of his woorde, in the feeldes of <note place="margin">Mat. 13</note> theire ſoules, if they will manure it; He cryethe vpon them, if they will <note place="margin">Pſal. 94</note> heare his voice: He commaundethe them to come, if they will obey his precepts: yet becauſe he will not draw any man but with free will, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereof is ſuche, that it can not ſtande with neceſſitye or violence: it will haue libertie to doe &amp; not doe.</p>
               <p>This free will, this to doe that we might haue omitted, this libertie, is

               <p>We buy then the Euchariſt, becauſe we geue God our free loue for it.

               <p>IT weare harde to diſcerne, whether is more ſweete to a good man, to be called the ſonne of God, or grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God that the iuſte call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For queſtionleſſe this tytle is the firſt &amp; ſole, with which God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs to call vpon him, in that ſacred prayer, which he him ſelfe regeſtred to be recyted of all his faithfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Pater noſter qui es in caelis.</hi> Our-Father which art in heauen. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before I receaue my heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will diſpoſe my ſelf, as a ſonn ought to preſent him ſelfe before ſuch a father.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorante that Chriſte as God, is my Father by creation, yea
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13329:78"/> more then my father, becauſe my ſoule did wholly procede from God, &amp; my body wherein my parentes chalenge theire part, by a more ſpeciall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente influence, was produced of God, then by my carnall progenitors. Therefore I will acknowledg my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure, as my Father, the principall. Author &amp; framer of my nature.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this agreeth to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwell as me: I will paſſe a litle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; call him myne adopting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea rather ſupernaturall Father by a newe regeneration in baptiſme, wheareby, the Adoption of God, ſurpaſſethe all other adoptions that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr betwixt men. <hi>Saluos nos fecit, per</hi>

               <p>All theſe conditions moſte excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently agree to Chriſte, in adoptinge men to the kingdome of heauen. For although God be our father and noe ſtranger vnto vs according to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet to eleuate vs ſupernaturally by grace, to the kingdome of glory, this oure nature can not chalenge, ſhe is a ſtraunger, it is not due vnto her, it procedeth of gods good will, mere ſupernaturall &amp; aboue the boundes of nature. And therefore in this reſpect we may be called ſtraungers to God, &amp; God to vs. 2 God haith a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſonne within him ſelfe, to whom all his kingdom apperteynethe, by as good right and tytle, as to him ſelfe: but for that he participateth the whole ſubſtance of his Father, and the ſame nature, therefore his bounty needed Sonnes of diſtincte nature from him ſelfe, ſpecially ſeing his kingdom was moſt ſufficient for all.</p>

               <p>But I know not how by receauing this bleſſed Sacrament, I am adopted in a more excellente manner, then by baptiſme, by iuſtification, by infuſion

               <p>Theſe be the cauſes of warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Sauiour Chriſt, &amp; this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous tyrant. Chriſte intendethe to glorify God: Sathan, to diſhonoure him. Chriſt would haue men to kepe Goddes commaundementes: Sathan
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13329:93"/> to preuaricate: Chriſte to conducte men to heauen, Sathan to caſte them downe to hell: Chriſte that one true God ſhoulde be worſhipped of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Sathan that either he him ſelfe, the fleſh, or the world, ſhould be adored as goddes. For what els pretended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than by diſgracing all the worlde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, with Idolatry, but (as S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorye <note place="margin">Orat. de calamitae. anim. ſuae</note> Nazeanzene well teachethe) to inioy in earthe, which he intended in heauen, that is, to be reuerenced of men in thoſe inſenſible Idols, as god? And therefore, the Prophet Dauid, <note place="margin">Pſal. 95</note> well called <hi>Deos gentium, daemonia,</hi> the goddes of gentiles, deuills. And he moſt impudently, was not aſhamed, to induce Chriſte to exhibit vnto him diuyne woorſhipp, <hi>Omnia haec dabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihi,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 4</note> 
                  <hi>ſi cadens adoraueris me.</hi> All theſe will I geue thee, if fallinge downe, thou wilt adore me. Why temptethe he glottons, with dayntie meates: but to make them belly goddes, <hi>Quorum</hi>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13329:94"/> an homage to Idoles, <hi>Quae est Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſeruitus,</hi> which is a ſlauerye to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles? <note place="margin">Collo. 3</note>
               </p>
               <p>By this diſcourſe, plainely it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, how theſe two general's diſplay their flagges, ſtryke vpp their dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes; they call euery man in this worlde, to this ſpirituall battayle. Noe man can free him ſelfe, euery one that liues, muſt ſtande either with Chriſte, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: be his ſrende, or his foe, there is no neuters, none may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>
               <p>Therefore my ſoule, now reſolue thy ſelf, whoſe part thou wilte take. Chriſt offereth thee croſſes, to geue thee glory: Sathan tranſitorye plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to bring thee to eternall paine: Chriſt inuiteth thee to warr, becauſe he loues thee, Sathan becauſe he hates thee: Chriſte in this Sacramente will feede thee with his blood to confirm thee, Sathan will poyſen thee with ſin to deſtroye thee: The armoure of Chriſt are Faith, Hope, Charitie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, mortification, with all the trowpes of vertue &amp; giftes of the holy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13329:94"/> Ghoſt, the armour of Sathan are, the fleſhe &amp; the world, ſelfe loue, ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, the rable of inordinate paſſions, the multitude of vyces, &amp; diabolicall ſuggeſtions. No doubte but if thou wilt, the victorie lyeth in thy handes, Reſiſt the deuill, &amp; he will flee from <note place="margin">Iac. 4 Eph. 6</note> thee: Put on the armour of Chriſte, &amp; they will defende thee: But looke well about thee, for the deuill is moſt vigilant, he neuer ſlepeth, &amp; thirſteth <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5</note> nothing ſo much, as the perdition of thy ſoule. For which cauſe, if God geue thee a good Angell, to guyde <note place="margin">Pſal. 90</note> thee leſte thou fall: he haithe thruſte vpon thee an infernall ſpirit, to make thee fall. If God ſende preachers, to exhort thee to penance &amp; perfection of lyfe: Sathan ſendeth ſectaries and worldlinges, to ouerſow cockle, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, <note place="margin">Mat. 13</note> and tares of ſtinkinge hereſves, fleſhly delightes, &amp; baiſe pleaſures, to bringe thee to eternall deathe. If god with examples of ſpirituall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, induce thee to pietie: he with exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of carnall men, will leade thee to vanitie. If God prouyde his ſeruantes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13329:95"/> to perſwade thee with deuout bookes to mortification; he will ſtirre vppe ſome frantick poete, with laſciuious rymes to intyce thee to diſſolution. If God ſtryke terroure into the ſoule, of death, of the ſynall Iudgment, or the paines of hell, to moue thee to amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente: he will inueigle thee with falſe argumentes of longe lyfe, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Goddes mercy, to make thee wallow deeper in vyce and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. Finally, what meanes ſoeuer he ſeethe, God vſe to ſaue thee, the lyke he inuenteth ſo neare as he can to damne thee. And therefore S. Paule forewarned vs, that we were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Eph. 6</note> to feight againſt fleſh &amp; blood, but againſt theſe ſpirituall and ghoſtlye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes, who impugne vs with greate aduantage: they beinge inuiſible vnto vs, and we beinge open to them: they ſpirits, and we compounded of foure corporall elementes: they long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in tempting, &amp; we litle in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting: they wonderfull wittye, &amp; we very dull and ignorante. But yet the grace of God, &amp; his good aſſiſtance,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13329:95"/> haithe more force to incyte vs to goe forwarde, then all the fendes of hell to goe backward. For, <hi>Omnia poſſum</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4</note> 
                  <hi>in eo qui me confortat.</hi> I can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com all, by vertue of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortethe me, with this comfortable foode, which terrifyeth all the trowps of Madian, this breade ſtryketh them <note place="margin">Iud. 7</note> deade. Therefore I would knowe, howe this warr of witt &amp; ſleight paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. All this battell betwixt oure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes &amp; vs, conſiſtethe in impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge the fortreſſes of our free willes: The deuill would haue vs to conſent to folow his vyces, &amp; Chriſte to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his vertues. If the deuill coulde neceſſitate vs to ſinne, or God would neceſſitate vs to goodnes: this battel weare ended. For then no doubt but a man ſhould ſtande lyke a block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and he that weare ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, ſhould preuayle &amp; carry it away.</p>
               <p>But the caſe ſtandeth not ſo: For ſmall glorye ſhoulde it be for a man of neceſſitie to be moued to loue god, or diſpraiſe to hate him: But ſtanding with free will betwixt them doth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13329:96"/> vſing conſtraint, but ſuch meanes as a man may accept, &amp; refuſe, vſe or abuſe, both knocke at the doore, &amp; leaue it in our libertie to open it. God inſpyreth, and the deuill ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: but neither inforceth. For if that God had not intended to ſaue vs with our free will &amp; libertie; to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, would he haue permitted thoſe impious ſpirits thus to range amongſt vs? to tempt vs? to ſeduce vs? For it weare ridiculous, to permitt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to tempt all men, if ſome coulde not reſiſt him, becauſe it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; &amp; others it weare impoſſible he ſhould ouercome.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what glorye ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downde to God, by forcing vs to do well? For who is ſo blockiſh that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not, that nothing is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his power and might? But if God leaue man to his libertie, and then he moue him to goodnes, and Sathan to vyce: if a man reſiſte Sathan &amp; ſeruc God, then plainely appearethe how God is glorifyed, by mannes well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge: For of his free election, he reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13329:96"/> fleſh &amp; blood, abandoneth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures &amp; delightes, onely for the loue, honour, &amp; glory, of God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly I will conſider the ſtratage<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Sathan, by what art he impugneth me. For ſince this ſpirituall battayle conſiſteth eſpecially in the vndermy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of our willes, in the deceiptes &amp; pollices of thc deuill: therefore as in warres, to diſcouer the ambuſhes, plottes, pollices, and ſtratagemes, of enemyes, is halfe the victory: Euen ſo to know the crafte of the deuill, is in greate part, to ouercome his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And withall, if Chriſte oure Captayne, haue prouyded vs meanes in this ſacrament to fruſtrate them, we haue almoſt wonne the battayle.</p>
               <p>Firſt the deuill in his temptations, &amp; warlye ſuggeſtions, extolleth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely that ſynn or pleaſure, he will perſwade vs. He vſeth all the retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick &amp; logick in his bugett, to painte it forth in liuely coloures; as a mount banke to prayſe his wares, his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynes, his pomainders, in ſuch ſorte, as by mere amplifications &amp; lyes, he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13329:97"/> deceyueth the poore ſimple people.</p>
               <p>Aſke our mother Eue, if after this ſort <note place="margin">Gen. 3</note> he did not ſeduce her, by tellinge her that her eyes ſhoulde be opened, ſhe ſhould become a god, knowing good &amp; euill. The lyke he daily practiſeth in his ſuggeſtions, for he will cauſe prowde men to conceaue ſuche a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh paradiſe in their ſtately buyldinges, their trayne of folowers, their rich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre, &amp; ſuche lyke vanities: that in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye deede, the verye moulde-hilles ſeeme mountaynes. How often doe riotous yonkardes and glottons, after their pleaſures be paſt, wonder at their owne blyndnes, that they pryzed ſo much, ſpent ſo muche, ladoured ſo much, for a thing of ſo ſmall delight? How they weare deceaued in balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the coſt, with that rotten &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy marchandyſe.</p>
               <p>The ſacred euchariſt, diſcouerethe this deceyte of the deuill, dy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith: for augmentinge our light, conſequently it diſcouereth the ambuſhes of Sathan, whlollye vnder ground &amp; in darknes. This lighte of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13329:97"/> faithe, the ſcriptures often inculcate vnto vs, as a moſt ſtronge defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the deuill? S.

And after he had declared, with how potent and daungerous enemyes; we weare to encounter, he exhorteth vs <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6</note> in all conflictes, to defende our ſelues wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h the ſheelde of faith: &amp; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is manifeſte, becauſe if the deuill ſeduce vs by lying, faith diſcouereth his deceyte, by reueyling vnto vs the truth: for who would euer hoard vpp goulde by hooke &amp; crooke, righte or wronge, if with the eyes of faith, he woulde but reade conſiderately, that ſentence, <hi>Foole this nighte thou ſhalte</hi>

The lyke I ſay of all other temptations, if our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faith be vigilant, they will quickly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe: for which cauſe I haue knowne many ſpirituall men, that had alwaies prepared godly ſentenſes, taken oute
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13329:98"/> of the ſcriptures, to protecte them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the temptations of the deuill.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde ſtratageme of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, conſiſteth in tempering his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations according to euery mans taſte. He conſidereth mennes complexions, their inclmations &amp; diſpoſitions, &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth euery one accordinge to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure. Drunkardes he allureth with delicate drinks: ambitious heads, with chimeres of honoure: worldlinges, with treafures: laſciurous ſpirits, with ſenſualitie. I think I red once in Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fianus, or Sophronius, that a godlye man entering into the church, he met the deuill, comminge forthe all loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with bottels &amp; glaſſes full of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roppes, &amp; drinkes. The good religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man knowing by reuelation it was the deuill, commaunded him in the vertue of Chriſte, to tell him what he did in the churche, with ſo many glaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes &amp; bottels? He anſweared, to geue euery one a ſiroppe, according to his ſo are: for rarely the deuill will tempt a yonge man with couetouſnes, or an oulde man with leachery, excepte the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13329:98"/> vyces of his youthe, be incorporated into the bones of oulde age. Seldom he moueth a ryche man to reuenge to kill or ſlea, or a poore man, to ſeeke for honour or reputation, excepte he fynde their complexions much incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereunto.</p>
               <p>Againſt this ſtratagem, the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt affordeth vs a moſt excellente de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for it in contrariwyſe, armethe not onely the ſoule, with all ſortes of vertues, but eſpecially with that grace that the ſoule moſt deſyreth, &amp; moſt nedeth. For as Manna ſerued euery manuestonge, of that taſte he wiſhed: ſo this celeſtiall Manna, euery good ſoule, of that fauour he craueth. For as in the noriſhment of oure bodies, when nature haith gotten the vpper hand of any diſeaſe, then moſt of that purer blood or ſpirits, which the liuer &amp; harte ſucke from oure meate; they ſende to reſiſt, expell, &amp; wholly va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh, the diſeaſe: So the Euchariſte noriſhing our ſoule, fouldinge our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure, who not onely with his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but alſo with his humanitie, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>The third deceipt, is not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at the firſt aſſaulte, to diſcouer his intention, but to winne ground by degrees, to inſinuate him ſelf by little &amp; little: he laieth his deceiptes, firſt to the heele, after intending to cruſh <note place="margin">Gen. 3</note> the heade, lyke vnto them who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to vndermyne or intrench them ſelues about a wall, they begin a farre of, &amp; then approch, leaſte if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted too neare, their plott ſhould be diſcouered.</p>

               <p>The reaſon why the deuill goethe ſo farr of at the beginninge, I take to be for moſt parte, with good ſoules, who if they did ſee diſtinctly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitye that Sathan intendethe, he could hardly preuayle againſt them. Therefore he blindeth their iudgment with ſome inordinate delight, (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fiſhers caſt theire nettes, when the water is troubled, that the fiſh ſhould not perceaue them) and then entreth with more facilitie.</p>
               <p>The way to ouercom this deceipte, is at the entrance of ſinne, to reſiſt it in the budding, for tender twigges, are bent with eaſe, aged trees breake eare they bende.

               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:13329:100"/>
               <p>The Euchariſt helpethe vs greatly, to ſmell theſe motions of ſinne, euen in their firſt ryſinge: becauſe the loue of God, the feruour of deuotion, two proper effectes thereof, ſo purify the Soule, that euery litle ſpot, may quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceaued, as in a whyte corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, euery ſtayne preſently appeareth. Moreouer by illuminatinge oure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge, it ſheweth theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which before we neuer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as in the beames of the ſunne, we ſee flying thowſandes of litle atomies or moates, which before we neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the deuill attendethe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, he watchethe fitt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to tempt vs: he marketh what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie we conuerſe with-all, what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are aflote, how the heauens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyne, what alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wether wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in our bodies, what exercyſe or quyetnes preceeded, &amp; according to all theſe, he gathereth a fitt tyme, to compaſſe his impious intention. So he came not to tempt Chriſt, till he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <note place="margin">Mat. 4</note> him ſo litarie in the deſerte, &amp; ahun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred

               <p>I omitt heare, how the verie miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſtes incarnation, openethe vnto vs manie ſecretts that we neuer hard of: how all his actions were our inſtructions, all his miracles, aſwell mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es to direct vs, as remedies to cure vs. Onely I intende here to conſider, by what maner, he teacheth me inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he ſpeaketh to my hart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any noyſe of woordes, &amp; how his inſpirations, may be perceaued.</p>
               <p>Secondly we can not doubt but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt our Sauiour verie often beateth at the doores of our hartes, ſpeakethe internally vnto vs. <hi>Ducam eum in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudinem, <note place="margin">Oſe 2</note> &amp; loquar ad cor eius.</hi> I will leade him into a deſert, &amp; will ſpeake to his harte. <hi>Ego ſto ad oſtium &amp; pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 3</note> (ſaith Chriſt) I ſtande at the dore of thy ſoule &amp; knock, that is, by the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13329:102"/> ſounde of his ſpirituall ſpeache. The ſpowſe in the Canticles tellethe, that <note place="margin">Cant. 5</note> ſhe harde the voyce of Chriſte knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, &amp; willing her to let him in: all the Scriptures inculcate this fauour of God, this calling, this light, this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne, this knocking, this ſpeakinge, of God to men, &amp; eſpecially to them who ſerue him deuoutly, &amp; heare his voyce attentiuely: Becauſe the Lawe of ſupernaturall frendſhippe betwene God &amp; his ſeruauntes, requyrethe a naturall conference, that one ſpeake to an other, that there paſſe a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate communication, wheare by loue is confirmed &amp; increaſed: and thoſe who haue the eyes of their ſoules pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed, well perceaue by deſiſting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer &amp; meditation, that their ſoules are thickned with a certain miſte, they ſeele not goddes frendſhipp ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as when they conuerſe with him, becauſe they do not attende <hi>Quid lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur in eis dominus,</hi> what our Lord ſpeaketh in them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, althoughe a man haue corporall eyes to ſee, yet he needeth
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13329:102"/> externall lighte, otherwyſe his eyes woulde litle auaile him: euen ſo litle it would auayle a man to haue a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wiſt, if the light of Goddes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall motion &amp; inſpiration, did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vs, &amp; cooperate with vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it importeth much, that I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> attend &amp; inclyne the eares of my hart, to heare the voyce of God, ſince he haith commaunded me. <hi>Audi filia &amp; <note place="margin">Pſal. 44</note> inclina aurem tuam.</hi> Here daughter (o ſoule) &amp; inclyne thyne eare, that is, doe not onely heare, but attende di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently: as thoſe who would here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, bende theire bodies &amp; theire eares to that parte, from whence the ſounde cometh. For queſtionles God ſpeakethe to me, becauſe he woulde be harde: &amp; therefore it were greate diſcurteſie &amp; irreuerence, not to geue him audience, eſpeciially ſpeakinge for my good, not his owne intereſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly I will conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of the teaching of Chriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and other maiſters which teache in the worlde: that thereby I may frame my ſoule the better to be a ſcholer in this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13329:103"/> ſupernaturall ſchole, &amp; the ſoner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande the voyce of my Sauioure, when he readethe vnto me his leſſons of lyfe, after I haue receaued his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſte other maiſters vſe corporall &amp; materiall woordes: Chriſte inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpeache.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Other maiſters can not cauſe their ſcholers to penetrate the depth of their doctryne, except they bring a naturall capacity &amp; vnderſtandinge with them which the maiſter is not able to impart vnto them: but Chriſt can call Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets from the plow, Apoſtles from their nettes, &amp; <hi>linguas infantum red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere</hi>

               <p n="6">6 Men moue not our affections, or at moſt verie weakely, to accept theyre doctrine: But our Sauiour moueth &amp; compelleth euen rebellious willes, to embrace his knowledg, &amp; cauſe the affection to enforce the witt, &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to approue hard miſteries of faith.</p>

               <p n="9">9 Men teach for their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie: but Chriſt for our gayne.</p>

               <p>5 Fifthly becauſe the deuill tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11</note> him ſelf into an angell of lighte, maſking his vglie ſhape vnder a goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don veyle, his impietye, vnder the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13329:104"/> form of religion. And as fowlers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tymes imitate the voyces of birds, to deceiue the ſimple thinges &amp; bring them as a praye to their nettes: in like ſorte he pretendinge to deceiue good ſoules, feaneth to ſpeake with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of heauen, the tongs of Angels, the voyce of god: &amp; except we attend very diligently, it will be harde euen for moſt ſpirituall men, to diſcern his voyce, yet theſe rules may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>The firſt rule is, that the motions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of God &amp; the deuill, differ in the ende eſpecially: for God moueth to good the deuill to euill: God to encreaſe in goodnes, the deuill to decreaſe.</p>
               <p>And thus by examininge our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether the motion aymeth, if the laſt ſcope be deuotion, pietie, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, then it can not but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from him: If it tende to ſinne, wickednes, or worldly delight, then queſtionleſſe the author thereof is the deuill: &amp; by often practiſing this rule, we ſhall fynde great facilitie in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueringe the motions of the two ſpirits.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13329:105"/> 
                  <hi>So oculus tuns ſimplex fuerit, totum cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pus</hi>

                  <hi>lucidum erit.</hi> If thyne eye be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (that is, thyne intention right) all thy bodie ſhall de light.</p>
               <p>God moueth the ſoule lyke a calm <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wynde, he falleth lyke a ſweete dew, <note place="margin">Gen. 3</note>

The reaſon hereof I take to be, the efficacy &amp; omnipotencie of God, who beinge the author of oure ſoules, can moue them in moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient manner, &amp; moſt agreable to our nature. The deuill moueth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtiouſly with vyolence, for <hi>non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 Re. 19</note> 
                  <hi>dominus,</hi> God is not in whirle wyndes. The reaſon is, becauſe the deuill haith not force to enter into the ſoule, in ſo ſweete a manner, as god entrethe, for that he entrethe to take
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13329:105"/> poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyke a tyrant, that is by force: but God entreth quietlye as a lawfull kinge into his kingdom. With this it may well ſtande that God ſom-times <note place="margin">Eccl. 43 3 Re. 19 Pſa. 104 Act. 2</note> vſeth great force in his motions, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge mountaines, &amp; cleuing harde rockes, deſcendinge lyke a vehement wynde, as vpon his Apoſtles at Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecoſt: but theſe motions rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede of the greate reſiſtance they fynde in obdurated ſinners, then their own nature. Euen as a riuer that ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calmly, if you ſtopp it, that it may not enioy an ordinarye courſe, you ſhall ſee how it will ſwell: &amp; if it find but one chinke to enter, with what force it paſſeth: ſo god when hee can not paſſe into mennes hartes in ſuche ſorte as he intendeth, he of neceſſitie muſte vſe ſome greater impluſion, to rowſe vpp thoſe deadly ſinnes which hindered his paſſage; &amp; with his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotente hande, cauſe the verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralles of the ſoule to tremble. <hi>Miſit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 5</note> 
                  <hi>manum ſuam per foramen, &amp; contremuerunt omnia viſcera mea.</hi> My loue put his hande by the hoale of the doore,

The which Chriſtes Apoſtles were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe in the conuerſion of greate ſinners, &amp; therefore oure Sauioure to ſhew that effect, ſent the holy Ghoſt vpon them, in forme of a vehemente wynde, which blowethe downe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges <note place="margin">Act. 2</note> &amp; rooteth vpp trees.</p>
               <p>This rule you may often tymes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in your ſelues, for good ſoules feele their hartes as it were reſolued, with the ſweetenes of deuotion, with deſyre to ſerue God, to kepe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, folowe vertue, flee vyce: &amp; can fynde oute no reaſon in the worlde, from whence ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould come, for God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly did vouchſaife to viſitt them.</p>
               <p>The third rule is, all theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> comonly proceede of god, which tende to the mortification of fenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the frequent receauinge of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, the exercyſe of pietie and mercy to our neighboures, of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Charitie to God: The reaſon is, becauſe the deuill can hardly enter into ſuch good woorkes, except by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13329:106"/> or vaine glory: the which may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well perceaued, if in the former, that is mortification, we follow our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſoures councell: and the other, we practyſe them more ſecretly, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly.</p>
               <p>Sixtly I will runne ouer a dayly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that euery Catholick may reade, writen in the externall garmentes of the Euchariſt: for God that ſpake and did, <hi>dixit, &amp; facta ſunt,</hi> he ſpake, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 32</note> they were made, can ſigniſy his mind &amp; reede vs leſſons, aſwell by viſible creatures, as audible ſoundes.

               <p>The circle of the hoaſt, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto me, the diuinity &amp; deitie of Chriſte, which is a moſte perfect cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whoſe center, is euery where,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13329:107"/> whoſe circumference is no where.</p>
               <p>It telleth me alſo, that as the circle comprehendethe the center on euery ſyde: ſo his immenſitye, fouldeth all places &amp; ſpaces: his eternitie, all time paſte, preſent, &amp; future. Moreouer this circle ſignifyethe the eternitye of glorie, the full bleſſednes that he will communicate, to all thoſe who receiue him condignely.</p>
               <p>The colour ſo whyte &amp; vnſpotted, teacheth me that vnder them lodgeth the onely ſon of a virgin, the flowre &amp; fauourer of virginitie, <hi>qui paſcitur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

Beſides it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uytethe chaſte ſoules to eate, becauſe theirby theire puritie ſhall be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; increaſed.</p>
               <p>The vnlcuened taſt, commaundeth me, to approche with ſinceritye, in truth &amp; really, for deuotion, for the loue of God, not with hipocriſie, not as to an ordinarye meate, but to eate &amp; feede indeede of my God.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:13329:107"/>
               <p>When I ſee the hoaſt eleuated by the preiſt, I remember that my Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure was heaued vpon the croſſe, to eleuate my ſoule, from ſenſualitie, to ſpiritualitie: from earth to heauen.</p>
               <p>When he deuydethe it in thtee partes, then I conſider how this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce, is offered to the glory of godds Sainctes in heauen, for expiation of thoſe ſoules which ſuffer in purgatory, &amp; for the manifoulde benefite of all Catholickes who liue in the Church militant. Moreouer how Chriſt was deuyded vpon the croſſe, his ſoule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his bodie, &amp; after vnited againe; and likewyſe with his blood, which in the chalice is vnited with the hoaſt.</p>

               <p>The comfort and ioy which wyne cauſeth in them that drinke it, the ioy &amp; heauenly conſolation that all thoſe participate, who deuoutly receiue him.</p>
               <p>The ſweete taiſt of wyne to the tong, foretelleth me, that here I am to begin the ioyes of heauen: and therefore I will endeuoure ſo to liue, that I may continew them, &amp; from the proofe, paſſe to the full poſſeſſion.

               <p>THe grounde &amp; baiſe of all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes, is out creation, for grace ſuppoſeth nature, as ſtones and foyle, the goulde which they adorne.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13329:109"/> Therfore becauſe I know this benefite the moſt auncient that I euer actually receaued of god: I will call it to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, acknowledg the gift, &amp; thank my benefactor: eſpecially vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, that the ſacred Euchariſte, is a Holocauſt or burnt offering inſtituted of my Sauiour Chriſte, in recogiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of our creation, conſeruation, and continuall fauoures, which God not onely as author of Grace, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as Father of nature, powrethe vpon his whole Churche. And in regarde that for this Tytle he is my Lord, and houldeth perfecte dominion ouer me: Therefore I will conſider what depen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dance, I haue of him, &amp; whar autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he rightly and iuſtly haithe ouer me.</p>
               <p>Firſt I will lifte vpp myne eyes to the bleſſed Euchariſt, &amp; with the moſte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> feruent faith of my harte confeſſe, that I acknowledg my Sauiour therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, the firſt woorkman that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me. I will contemplate a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tyme before my natiuitie, when I was neither borne, conceyued, nor
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13329:110"/> memory was hadd of me in the world: If then it had bene poſſible for me to haue requeſted of God, that he would make me a man: what gratitude would I haue promiſed? what ſeruice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? what homage vndemau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto him? Ah ſhall I be now more vngratefull, becauſe he beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on me the benefyte vnaſked, then if he had graunted it requeſted? This demeanour indeede, were too diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and therefore what then in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; diſcretion I woulde haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, now with all zeale &amp; loue, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intende to performe, that is becauſe I haue receaued all of him, all I will render to him againe: and that which he beſtowed on me of mere liberality, with all free liberty I will returne, <hi>cui</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 118</note> 
                  <hi>omnia ſeruiunt,</hi> to whom all thinges ſerue and ought to ſerue.</p>
               <p>I will conſider my caſe in my mothers <note place="margin">2 Iob. 10</note> wombe, with Iob, <hi>Sicut lac coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt cor meum,</hi> Euen as milke is my hart crudded together. with Dauid, &amp; <note place="margin">Pſ. 138 2 Mac. 7</note> that 7 tymes martyred mother, of the Machabees: howe I appeared in that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13329:110"/> darcke night which continued ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months, without any ſpark of light, or appearance of day.</p>
               <p>How was this artificiall clock of my body compacted together: this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall comon weale, ſo well ordered: this buyldinge, ſo well contriued, ſo iuſt a conſort obſerued, in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct partes? Without all doubt this admirable workmanſhippe of bones, fleſh, ſinowes, vaines, cartilages, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles, ſenſes, hart, lyuer, milt, braine, with a nomber of other partes, ſtroke The prophane Philoſophers, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the wonderfull power and wiſdom of God, who could frame ſo ſtrange a worke, in ſo ſecret a maner. And the wyſer ſorte herevpon gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, an inuincible argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince all atheiſtes, that there was a God. For who coulde be ſo madd to imagin, that ſuche a worthy woorke, could come by chance, which yet the profoundeſt wittes, can ſcarce perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtande. Therefore I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this bleſſed Sacrifice, as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my Faith, &amp; a ſigne of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13329:111"/> to the indeuyded Trinity, in recognition of this vniuerſall &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer gift, wherein ſhyneth the light of Goddes ineffable wiſdom and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</p>
               <p>Thirdlye, if it had pleaſed God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he might in this palace of my bodye, haue cloſed vpp the windowes, as he did to the blynde borne begger, and <note place="margin">Io. 9</note> many more, who would ſpend almoſt what they haue, to enioye the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte of their eyes: he mighte without contradiction or oppoſition, haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reued me of a legg, an arme, or ſome other principall part, the which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lack, or poſſeſſe very deformed, yet of his bounty he haithe graunted them wholl &amp; intyer to me. Therefore the integritie of his gifte, exacteth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer oblation, and full vſe of them to his honour &amp; glory. Wherefore ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I ſee any perſon deformed, lame, blyndè, or deſtitute of any limme: preſently I will take occaſion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert my ſoule to God, &amp; bleſſe him, who haith deliuered me from ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, not for myne owne deſert, but

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly by this tytle of my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I may well accompt my ſelfe as one, who owethe all that he haith or can to God: That I am his vaſſall, his poſſeſſion, a ſheepe of his flocke, a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For if a kiug hould right ouer his kingdom, he needeth his ſubiectes, he can not be without them, neither in warres, nor peace.

               <p>Fynally no creature obeyeth ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly his Lord &amp; Prince, as it dothe Chriſt, who with a woord can chaung their natures, tranſforme water, into <note place="margin">Io. 2 Mat. 21 Marc. 11 Luc. 1</note> wyne, cauſe a barayn tree to floriſhe, an oulde woman to beare a childe, a Virgin to conceaue. Therefore, O bleſſed Sauioure, I will call thee my true Lorde, myne onely Lorde, my moſt mightie Creator. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Fifthlye I will confounde my ſelfe with ſhame, to ſee all thinges ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to my Chriſte, that the verie <note place="margin">Mat. 8 Marc. 4 Luc. 8</note> inſenſible wynde, the raging ſea, be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the knees of theire natures, to obey his preceptes, &amp; I whom God haith endewed with reaſon, inſpyred ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ſo many benefits, ſhould ſo irreuerentlye tranſgreſſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes.

               <p>Heare o Lorde I may if I will, reade the homage that thy cteatures yeelde vnto thee, &amp; by their example I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with thy grace, hereafter more obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſly to ſerue thee.

               <p>Milk in many thinges agreeth with the Euchariſt, by woorking in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies corporally, that which the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt worketh in our ſoules ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>Firſt milke is both meate &amp; drink, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> &amp; therefore you way both eate it, &amp;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13329:121"/> drink it. He that eateth Chriſts body drinketh it alſo, and he that drinkethe his blood, eateth it lykewyſe. He that eateth his body, together drinketh his blood, &amp; he that drinketh his blood, eateth his body. For which cauſe, he that is eaten here, the infinite wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, expreſly ſaid, <hi>Qui edunt me,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat. 5</hi>
                  </note> Bleſſed are they that hunger &amp; thirſte after righteouſnes. The Euchariſt ther fore either eaten or drunke, filleth the ſoule with righteouſnes, &amp; therefore, quencheth the thirſt as drinke, &amp; ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth the body as meate. The The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall reaſon hereof, may eaſely be yelded, for all ſpirituall foode, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well drink as meate: becauſe as drink
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13329:122"/> it cooleth the feruent deſyres in parte, &amp; as meate, it mainteyneth with grace &amp; vertue, the ſpirituall lyfe of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>By this we may manifeſtly perceaue the fooliſh importunitie of the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans &amp; Calueniſtes ſtill calling for the cupp, cenſuring the church of ſacriledg for depriuing the laitie of the chalice. For if they coulde penetrate the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nature, and effectes of ſpirituall foode: they woulde neuer fall into ſuch an abſurdine. For he that eateth Chriſtes body, both eateth &amp; dtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his blood, aſwell as the prieſte, &amp; he that drinketh his blood, eateth no leſſe of his body, then he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth his body. For in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſte vnder the rynde of breade, there lyeth nothing but that lyeth vnder the rynde of wyne in the Chalice: nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwyſe, nothing vnder the rynde of wyne in the Chalice, but the very ſame is receaued vnder the rynde of breade in the hoaſt: In ſo much as he which participate the both of the breade and wyne, &amp; he that onely particrpate the of one: receueth as perfectly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13329:122"/> the body &amp; blood of Chriſte, as he that communicateth with them both: Yet for a more ſenſible &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſignification, the prieſt offereth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumeth them both, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance receaued, &amp; the effectes inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the ſoule, are as intier &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in one, as in both: in a myte, as a mountaine: in a dropp, as a butte.</p>
               <p>By this it appeareth, that Chriſtes bodie in the the Sacrament, as drink quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the thuſte, by fulfilling the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent deſyres of them that loue God: by coolinge the flames of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, by mitigating the vehemente affections of worldlye delightes: As meate, it reſtoreth the loſte forces of our ſoules by ſinne, augmenteth our grace, encreaſeth our ſpirituall lyfe, &amp; finally affordethe all thoſe effectes of meate, in a more excellent degree to our ſoules, then any corporall meate to our bodies: &amp; therefore is meate &amp; drinke, and milke, for ſucklinges of God.</p>
               <p>Milke, of all meates, is one of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> moſt ſimple nonſhments that we haue:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13329:123"/> It needeth neither baking, boylinge, nor roaſtinge, as other meates requite, for in the mothers breſte, it is baken, brewed, boyled, &amp; roaſted: &amp; ſo the infante without any other ſauce, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply &amp; ſolely, draweth it from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dugge.</p>
               <p>By which proprietie we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that with four ſimple wordes, withowt any tergiuerſation, labour, or payne: the prieſt drawethe this ſacred milke from the breſte of Chriſts loue. And how lyke infantes with ſimplicity not curiouſly queſtioninge how it was made, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed vnder the formes, how it lodgeth vnder thoſe veyles of breade &amp; wyne, howe we oughte to ſucke it: for infantes vſe noe ſuche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but ſimply ſuck that their mother geueth. So the infantes of Chriſt begotten with his blood ſhould ſimply receaue, that their mother the catholick Churche, miniſtrethe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; folow that ccu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <note place="margin">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13329:123"/> without deceipt, not without reaſon: for the beſt reaſon that an infante can haue, is to ſuck that his mother geueth. And ſo the greateſt reaſon that the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt children of Chriſt can yeld, is not their owne iudgmente, but the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in interpreting ſcriptures, in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the conferences of places, in ordevning the manner &amp; vſe, of this bleſſed foode.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we may learne, how as this Sacrament is the meat of our ſoules all the tyme of oure peregrination: ſo we ſhoulde lyue alwaies lyke infantes in lyfe and conuerſation, ſimple lyke <note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. For this ſimplicity bringeth great peace to our ſelues, and makethe vs gratefull to others; It winneth greate fauour with God, &amp; therefore is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedinglye commended in ſcriptures. For with whom doth God moſte fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly talke and conuerſe? with the ſimple, <hi>Cum ſimplicibus ſermocinatio e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi>

               <p>Much more might be ſaid of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled vertue, but that I think the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Chriſt ſo great, that all I can ſay, woulde rather diminiſh the glory, then adde any luſtre vnto it.</p>

Therefore vnderſtanding that God will geue his giftes, but yet he will be demaunded: according to the exigence of my neceſſitie, I will fall downe before my Sauiour, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre his fauoure. Neither doth this-Decree, preiudicate the depthe of his bountie, &amp; liberalitie. For in that he will not graunte vs graces &amp; fauoures ordinarily, without praier, it is a great grace &amp; fauour. Becauſe a troupe of vertues we reuiue, by praying to god, &amp; ſo meritt the more and enable our ſoules, the better to reſiſt all ſortes of vyces &amp; ſinnes. For who praieth and exercyſeth not his Faith, in beleuinge that God can graunt his requeſt? His hope, that God will heare him? His Charitie, in louing him, of whom he expecteth good? His humilitie, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing by the verie aſking his owne in digence? His patience, in expectinge that he demaundeth? His fortitude, in reſiſting the difficulties, which occurr

               <p>Moreouer by prayer we come to be familier with God, for mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference &amp; often talking, engendreth familiaritye, which is a ſpeciall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>By prayer alſo theſe giftes which we receaue of God, are more glorious, &amp; by meritt, due vnto vs, which is a worthier tytle for vs, then if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded of pure liberalitie: As if a king ſhould geue two horſes to two cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, who doubteth, but if the one receaued his for worthie exploytes in warr, &amp; the other of the kinges mere affection, that that were more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the former, then this to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Moreouer, as Fathers will haue their children, to aſke them what they neede, that thereby they may knowe what bonde they haue to their parents, &amp; ſo loue them the better, and ioine their hartes more affectually. So god will geue vs his graces by prayer, that we acknowledge the ſpeciall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance we hould of him, that by knowing

Finally, that we kepe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that which we obteyned by great labour: for thinges ſone gotten, are commonly contemned: &amp; purchaced with difficultie, highly prized.</p>

Becauſe I doubt not, but he is more ready in this Sacrament, to hear our ſutes, graunte our petitions, and further vs in all goodnes, then he was to them in the ould teſtament.

               <p>They ſaid that God was in all parts corners &amp; ſecrets of this worlde; that he gaue lyfe, motion, operation, and vnderſtanding to all his creatures: &amp; informed this world in ſuch ſorte, as our ſoule informeth the body. In this they were deceaued: but in the formet they hitt the marke a-right. For god is no forme or ſoule of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoule nedethe the bodye to make a man, &amp; otherwyſe it is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: But God of him ſelfe conſiſteth moſt perfectlye &amp; completlye. But if we ſeperate from the ſoule all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as to be a parte, to ſtande neede of any bodie, to depende of it in operation, to enform it as a diuine ſubſtance: then we may conceaue the maieſtie of God, as a complete and moſt excellent ſpirit, diffuſed through the whole world, as a ſoule throughe the whole body of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1 For as the ſoule is a ſpiritt, ſo God is a ſpiritt.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:13329:156"/>
               <p>2 The ſoule inhabiteth in euery part of the bodye: &amp; God in euery parte of the world. 3 The ſoule geuethe lyfe &amp; beinge to all partes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, according to their capacities: &amp; God imparteth lyfe &amp; beinge to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, according to their natures. 4 The ſoule concurreth with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to all motions &amp; operations: and God with all the world in euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 5 The ſubſtance of the ſoule, wholly reſydeth in the whole body, &amp; wholly in euery part: &amp; God reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with his preſence, in the whole world, &amp; wholly in euerie parte. 6 The ſoule ſeperated from the body ſubfiſteth by it ſelfe: &amp; god withoute the worlde in him ſelf.</p>
               <p>Many moe conueniences might be brought, but theſe I think ſufficiente to frame a moſt maieſticall conceipte of Godds preſence in the worlde, as of a moſt ſimple, intiere, &amp; perfecte ſoule, in ſo huge &amp; mightie a bodie.</p>
               <p>When I preſent my ſelf before the bleſſed Sacrament, I will conceaue the preſence of God, vnder ſome one of

               <p>IN the laſt Chapter was declared, that our Sauiour Chriſt accordinge to his Diuinitye, and all the three perſons in Trinitie, were preſente in the Euchariſte. 1 By the attribute of their immenſitie, where by they fill all places, &amp; are indiſtant from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 2 By the admirable effecte of their omnipotencye, by inſerting the nature of man, into the ſtocke of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:13329:158"/> ſeoonde perſon by incarnation. 3 By the particuler worke, reall preſence, &amp; peculiar vnion of Chriſts bodye, with the formes &amp; accidentes of breade &amp; wyne, not by Hipoſtaticall connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, but by Sacramentall coniunction. 4 By the admirable dependance that one perſon haith of an other, that where one is of neceſſitie. the other two muſt be with him. All theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of preſence, we comprehended in the precedent Chapter, of Goddes diuine preſence: Here onely we will conſider the preſence of Chriſtes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitye, &amp; what we may note there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as mouinge to deuotion.</p>
               <p>That Chriſts humanitie, really, ſub ſtantiallye, corporallye, liuinglye, in ſenſe, fleſh, blood, bones, &amp; ſoule, without extention, or dimention of place, allodgeth in this Sacramente, was proued in the booke of cauſes of the inſtitution. And therefore inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here not to deale with proteſtants but Catholikes: I meane not to paſſe any further in this poynte.</p>
               <p>As for the other, the conſideration
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13329:159"/> of Chriſts humanitie, may diuers waies ſtirr vpp our remiſſnes in deuotion, &amp; reuyue the feruour of Charitie: becauſe not onely as God he ſeeth &amp; marketh all thinges done or to be done in this worlde: but alſo as man, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt contemplation, of his fathers eſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence, as in a moſte cleare Chriſtall glaſſe, he behouldeth all the worlde, in vniuerſall, &amp; euery member, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; part, in particular; &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently me with all the courſe of my whole lyfe: The ſinnes committed, repented, pardoned: his graces im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, accepted, effectually put in execution, my preparation to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with all cit cumſtances ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as tyme howe longe or how ſhort: as place in priuate or in publique: in the Church or my chamber: the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, intenſiuely or remiſly: with what difficultie or facilitie: with what helpes, or what hinderances: with what intention, for charitie, or for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for goddes glorie or hipocriſie: to increaſe in deuotion, or for ſome ſenſible conſolation.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:13329:159"/>
               <p>All theſe he behouldeth, and a thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tymes better in god, then I know them myſelfe. Therefore euidently it appeareth, how carefull &amp; vigilante, I ought to appeare before ſo exacte, ſo continuall, ſo zealous, ſo Ieleous a behoulder. 2 With the corporall eares of his bodie, with his corporall eyes, he heareth all I ſpeake, &amp; ſeeth all my externall carriage &amp; demeanour of my body.

               <p>AFter I haue ſwallowed all the riches of heauen &amp; earth Chriſt Ieſus, in the bleſſed Euchariſte, becauſe he remainethe ſo longe with me, as the veyles of breade &amp; wyne are not diſſolued with the naturall heat of my ſtomake. Therefore I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to geue him that interteyne ment that my ſpirituall pouertie can afford: for herein I know conſiſteth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13329:165"/> good that I muſt receaue by this Sacramente, next after the grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> that is, ſor the onely woorke of receauing.</p>
               <p>I knew ſome godlye and religious men, who all this whyle did nothing els, but crye both with tonge &amp; harte <hi>Diligo te Ieſu, I</hi> loue thee o my Ieſu, I loue thee o my Ieſu. And this aboue a hundreth tymes they reiterated: and truly they toulde me that they founde ſinguler comfort &amp; conſolation. And certainely in thoſe who loue God affec tually, &amp; tenderly: I doubt not but as theſe actes or affectes of Charitie paſſe all other in worth &amp; meritt: ſo they paſſe in cauſinge ſpirituall ioy &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Others I knew, who would onely attend to kepe their ſoules fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thoughtes, impertinent cogitations and affections, that they might heare the voice of Chriſt within them. For doubtles he that vouchſafed to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, will not diſdaine to ſpeake vnto them who deſyre to heare his voyce, to execute his will. This deuotion can not but yealde great contentation and

               <p>The manner which I practiſe and I know many moe daily to exercyſe, I was taugdt of a moſt godly &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned religious man, who as he loued me well, ſo he was content to dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me this treaſure, the which he for humilitye, woulde not diuulgate to others, yet with godds grace for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie I will deliuer it.</p>
               <p>For a quarter of an hour after he had receaued, he did meditate nothing but onely breake forth into ſundrie affects exhaling from his hart to heauen, the ſweteſt incenſe of vertue, that his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour could raiſe, or ſuch a gueſt would inflame: The which for memory ſake he comprehended in this one worde, <hi>Agape.</hi> By A, the firſt letter, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deiſtoode <hi>Amor,</hi> &amp; with it, Faith, &amp;

               <p>Theſe noble acts of moſt excellent vertues, he practyſed after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. O Ieſu I beleue in thee, I hope in thee, I loue thee. I beleue in thee ſweete Ieſu, but augment my Faith. I truſt in thee, but confirme my hope. I loue thee, but inſlame my Charitie.</p>
               <p>O my Ieſu, I beleue thou art preſent now within me; Ah, now I hope thou wilt help me. O my Ieſu, for this thy comminge, I woulde gladly loue thee.

What temptations ſoeuer aſſault me, with thy grace I will reſiſt valiantlye: What aduerſity ſoeuer befall me with thy grace I will beare it patiently: what croſſes ſoeuer thou wilt impoſe vpon me, with thy grace I will carry them with alacritie.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:13329:172"/> occaſion hinder me from vertue, then I knowe the ſame may conſequently bring me to ſinn. 4 I will meditate what meanes or remedies, I may vſe to auoy de ſuch euill neighboures with intention to put them in execution ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. 5 I will aſke ſom ſpirituall men &amp; eſpecially my ghoſtly father, how I may ouercom ſuch an euill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp; according to their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, helpe myſelf as well as I can.</p>
               <p>Much here might be handled in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, how we ſhould extirpate any vyce, or plante any vertue, but it were not ſo conuenient for this place.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde poynte &amp; of noe leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> importancethen the firſte, we may put in practiſe by obſeruinge theſe rules, 1 If we glorifye God in our ſelues, by prayer. 2 By receauing his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes deuoutly. 3 By mottifyinge our bodies for his honour. 4 By ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting all thinges we can conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye with feruour &amp; deuotion, offering euery Exercyſe we doe, to his glorie. In others. 1 By our modeſtie &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall gouernment, without pryde or
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:13329:172"/> vanitie in our attyre, geſtures, or any actions. 2 By woordes oſ edification prudence, and diſcretion, that they ſmell of deuotion &amp; pietie, &amp; carry the colour of that hart wherein they were dyed. 3 Becauſe I vnderſtand Goddes glory to conſiſt, in true and humble ſubiection of my ſoule, to his diuyne maieſtie, in a ſeuere iudgment &amp; rigour to my ſelfe, &amp; in bowells of mercy and compaſſion, towardes my neighboures: Therefore about theſe three obiects, my diſcourſe ſhall be occupyed: how I may increaſe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of theſe, the honour of god by endeuoring to conuert heritykes, confirm catholikes, correct ſinners, reduce offenders to a better lyfe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the vertuous to more perfection. 4 With the moſt ſincere affection of my ſoule, I will demaunde of my bleſſed Sauiour, that he will teach me wherein I may glorify him moſt: and by experience I finde this petition, by a common effect of great conſolation, to be moſt aceptable vnto God. For in verie deede, how can ſuch a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13329:173"/> be but gratefull, wherein a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> venteth the verie center of his hart, to exhale owt ſuch heauenly deſyres, ſo reaſonable, ſo affectious, ſo pure, ſo worthy of man, ſo ſutable to god?</p>
               <p>5 The nature of loue, will finde out twentie new inuentions how to glorify god, &amp; by ſealinge euery one with the Image of Charitie, relatethe them all to his honour &amp; glory. Therfore he that loueth, lacketh not meanes to glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rify god.</p>
               <p>The thirde pointe of tranquillity &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> peace of conſcience, as it reſembleth the lyfe of the iuſte, to a certaine ſtate of bleſſednes: ſo it helpeth them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedinglye, to make progreſſe in all ſortes of vertue. For as delight is the whetſtone that ſharpneth all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo peace of conſcience, reuyueth &amp; geueth a new edge, to all religious operations. Wherefore he that inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a paradiſe in earth, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this internall peace: He that would auoyde many difficulties that a good lyfe carrieth incident vnto it, let him inioye this peace. Theſe meanes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:13329:173"/> may ſerue them that deſyre it. Firſte all men trye by experience, that there be two ſortes of cogitations, ſom of vertue, ſom of vyce. Vertuous thoughtes leaue after their departure, a ſugred taſte &amp; ſweete contentation: Vitious thoughtes thruſt in their ſtinge, and afterwarde the ſoule feeleth the paine of poyſen by temorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; vnquietnes of mynde.</p>
               <p>He then that intendeth peace muſt of neceſſitie auoyde all vitious cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo neare as he can, &amp; eſpecially thoſe of fleſh &amp; blood, the which as they moleſt vs oftneſt, ſo their ſtinge is moſt ſenſible: yet if we fall into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe, the remedye of preſente rep entance, preſenteth it ſelfe: aſke pardon of God, &amp; this paine will be releaſed.</p>
               <p>2 After the holy Euchariſte is recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: a man muſt be verie circumſpect in his woordes, &amp; in all other actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as eatinge, drinking, conuerſing, &amp;c. That he doe not ſpill &amp; powre owte, that water of lyfe, which by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating he receaued. For deuotion,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13329:174"/> and peace of mynde, as in an inſtant, God diſtilleth them into the ſoule: ſo in an inſtant they vaniſh away. And let him by litle &amp; litle withdraw him ſelf from ſenſible delightes which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affordeth, &amp; ſenſualitie earneſtly affecteth: For internall delight &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall pleaſure, though honeſt &amp; lawfull hardly conſorte together. Therefore learned men counſell thoſe that would make progreſſe in ſpirit, to vſe pleaſure &amp; play, as medicines: not to ſatiate, but for neceſſitie: not as men that liue for pleaſure, but as they that take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to liue. 3 A man muſte often renew his purpoſes, &amp; reſerue in the treaſory of his memorie, ſom affectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all iaculatorye prayer, or eleuation of his mynde to god, which was diſtilled in the heate of his feruoure, when he receaued the Euchariſt, as, Inflame me ſweete Ieſu with thy loue. O my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, fortify me againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall I ſee thee O Lorde? When ſhall I freelie poſſeſſe thee? By <note place="margin">

                  </note> experience I fynde, theſe prayers moſt forcible, to collecte &amp; vnite the ſoule
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13329:174"/> with God, to engender great peace, to be of great efficacie, to make vs to conſider the preſence of God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vs to prayer, at what tyme ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. They are bellowes that blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the aſhes from the coales of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, &amp; ſo reuyue them. They carrie away the defects &amp; imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the diſtractions and inordinate paſſions, which couer the bright colour of gods grace. They are dartes launſhed from the harte of mans loue, to the hart of gods loue. By them we may kepe our feruour from one ſonday we commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, to another. By them finally we ſeme to flye to god, to enioye in this lyfe, the ſwete co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly delights &amp; familiar conuerſation in loue, the which they onelye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande who haue proued: howbeit for all men god haith prepared it: The which I befeche him graunte to all thoſe that deſyre to taiſt it in this lyfe, &amp; poſſeſſe it in the other.
